## Sound-Controlled-Car-Project
A project was done at the University of the Witwatersrand where students were put into groups and tasked to design an RC car that is completely controlled by sound. The group used  a Dual Tone Multi Frequency approach. The car performed in the top 5 of all the cars designed. 

This repo contains some basic code used to get the project working and my report of the project, including design desicions.
